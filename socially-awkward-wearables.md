^ Camera on choker

^ Camera is attached to rpi

^ RPI is running javascript & an image recognition model

^  ML model on the pi determines how many people it sees

^ sends info to an arduino.

^ The arduino is controlling the lights on the necklace.

^ it updates the colors and patterns of leds based on parameters i've set for how it should respond.

^ I felt awkward, but got lots of compliments.

^ try to channel that anxiety into a fascination & excitement

^ use them to confront my discomfort of the attention they attract.

### I found inspiration at the Stedelijk.

^Stedelijk museum in Amsterdam

^I went to see an exhibition of art by Jean Tinguely.

### Jean Tinguely

![original](photos/tinguely.jpg)

^ Jean Tinguely

^ Swiss, 60s/70s

^ Art NOT about standing in a sterile white space, distantly gazing silent painting

^ Art meant to be playful

^ Created installations meant to be triggered by a viewer

^ The viewers's experience was integrated into the overall effect of the work itself

^ It intentionally blurred the line between artist and viewer

^ The viewer is invited to choose a drawing tool (marker, pen, or pencil) and place it in a holder.

^ When put into motion, it moves it along a piece of paper.

^ The result would be a work of art in itself.

^ No longer just watching a process, the viewer, by choosing the drawing tool, plays a role in the creation of an entirely new work of art.

---

> I wanted something ephemeral that would pass like a falling star...<br/><br/>The work had to just transpire, make people dream and talk, and that would be all.
> - Jean Tinguely

^ At the exhibit, this quote by Tinguely stood out to me.

^ Really liked idea of art as a temporary experience that connects an artist and viewer

^ It's spontaneous and,

^ Only meant to bring joy and inspire for short time

### [tiny.cc/haute-codeture](http://tiny.cc/haute-codeture)

<br>

^ inspired

^ purposefully wanted to explore creating a temporary experience that connected strangers to me through my outfit.

^  app to control the lights

^ Anyone on the web could change colors and patterns

^ Lots of coding: React, NodeJS, MQTT, Arduino

^ Lots of soldering

---

![50% autoplay loop right](photos/haute-app.mov)

## [fit] a web app for your outfit is
## [fit] both good and bad

^ question who is the artist in that moment?

^ Explored the interactions that might occur when people realize it's interactive via app.

^ More interested: responsive to what i was experiencing

^ rather than input from others

^ built this to see if people would pay attn to me more when i spoke.

^ NodeJS server sends audio to google speech recognition api

^ gets  keywords

^ sends google search api from and finally is showing an image that correlates to what i'm saying.

### (I just thought I was using an API)

^ Ironically I also didn't realize I had worked with ML in this project until I really looked back and thought about this project again.

^ ML is so pervasive

^ used it here

^  Just thought I using an API that I sent data to and got a response.

---

![left autoplay loop fill](photos/ml-necklace.mov)


^ take this concept of wearable responsive to me but built to be viewed by those around me

^ responsive to people around me but increases my discomfort unless i conform to social norms

^ obnoxious, flashy, attention getting when alone

^  only calm when sociable & surround with other people.

^ less about purposefully using lights to attract people

^ more about me wanting to get rid of the lights as fast as possible

^ this progression of my work is a convincing reason for me to build this necklace

^ misled you

---

### New Job at big tech company

^ moment of self-doubt & inadequacy

^ yr ago, new job at a big tech co

^ felt really insecure with my skills

^ folks started a ML study group

^ falling behind from the first study group

^ i wanted to prove that i could learn all these concepts in my own style.

^ create a physical use case for ML that was relevant to me and my interests

^ the real reason i built this is because I couldn't keep up with a ML study group at work.

---

![autoplay loop](photos/ml4a.mp4)

^ the ML 4 artist courses by gene kogan

^ open my eyes to what artists and non-traditional technologists doing

^ they gave me ideas on how i could integrate ml into a new wearable project

^ Wekinator builds these models using supervised machine learning algorithms. Instead of creating the model function by writing code, you create models by providing training examples of inputs and the outputs that should correspond to them. A learning algorithm builds a model from the training examples.

^ But i wanted to code it

---

![autoplay loop](photos/coding-train.mp4)

^ i wanted to do all the machine learning in JS -> Tensorflow.js

^ Library for training & running machine learning models in the browser
(or Node.js)

^ browser not possible on rpi

^ There were 2 things i wasn't sure from beginning if they were even possible:

^ 1. running ml models in node instead of browser

^ 2. run ml models in node on a rpi
