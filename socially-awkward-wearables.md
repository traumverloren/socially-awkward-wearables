## [fit] *WHY* is just as important as *HOW*

---

# [fit] A wearable that forces me 
# [fit] to be *around people* in order to
# [fit] *not* DRAW ATTENTION

---

### I'm a bit introverted, awkward & anxious in social situations.

---

### [fit] I'm *fascinated* with making myself 
### [fit] uncomfortable in public

^It's terrifying & counterinituitive but

---

# [fit] Earlier experiments with wearables

^ Over past couple years, I've made a couple of wearable projects to gradually explore wearing lighted wearables in public

^ How people react in general

^ How people react to me being the maker

^ How I react to people reacting

# Experiment #1:<br/>Jellyfish Dress

- Bought a kit: [tiny.cc/fiber-optic-kit](tiny.cc/fiber-optic-kit)
- Followed an Instructables tutorial
- No coding, pre-programmed
- No soldering, only sewing

---

![fill left](photos/bike-ride.jpg)

## [fit] First time wearing lights 
## [fit] & people liked it!

---

![fill left](photos/bike-ride.jpg)

## [fit] A Bit Lifeless

^ ~6 months coding experience
^ Next logical step was to actually code something

---

![fill autoplay loop](photos/intro-clip.mov)


^ Multiple coordinated pieces
^ Anyone on the web could control the lights

---

![50% autoplay loop right](photos/haute-app.mov)

# Experiment #2:<br/>Haute Codeture

- Lots of coding:
    - React, NodeJS, MQTT, Arduino
- Lots of soldering
- [tiny.cc/haute-codeture](http://tiny.cc/haute-codeture)

---

![fill left](photos/haute-codeture-2.jpg)

## People *really* liked controlling how I looked.

---

![fill left](photos/haute-codeture-2.jpg)

## *Limitations:*
## Dependent on wifi and an app

^ Stuck with keeping my phone on me, having a network connection

---

# Experiment #3:<br/>Speech-to-Image Necklace

![fit left autoplay loop](photos/IMG_6459.mp4)

- Some coding:
    - NodeJS
    - Google cloud speech recognition API
    - Google Custom Search API
- No soldering
- [tiny.cc/speech-to-image](http://tiny.cc/speech-to-image)

---

![fit left autoplay loop](photos/IMG_6459.mp4)

# [fit] Responsive without any direct input

# [fit] but needed wifi to work

---

# [fit] I accidently made something
# [fit] with *machine learning* & didn't realize it.

# Making An Autonomous necklace

![left autoplay loop fill](photos/ml-necklace.mov)

^ rest of the talk I want to talk through how i built this and the different tech challenges i faced

---

### I couldn't keep up with a machine learning study group at work.

^But  the real reason i built this is because I couldn't keep up with a machine learning study group at work that was doing a big MOOC course.

^ Everyone else learning fast
^ All theoretical no practical/tangible
^ ML4A & Coding Train

### Prove myself

### &

### Validate my learning style

# [fit] It was hard and
# [fit] I got demotivated

^ Build time: 8 months vs. 3 months

---

# [fit] I still know very little 
# [fit] about machine learning

---

# [fit] I'm good at figuring out things
# [fit] I don't understand

^ demotivated alot of this year
^ easy to hyperfocus and tweak one bit

# Autonomous Necklace Recipe

1. Get image recognition ML model running on **Node.js**
2. Run TensorFlow.js on **Raspberry Pi!**
3. Send camera pic to image recognition model on Raspberry Pi
4. Create a LED necklace
5. Send image data from the Raspberry Pi to the necklace
6. Make the necklace responsive to data

# TensorFlow.js

^ Library for training & running machine learning models in the browser
(or Node.js)


^ it's mostly geared towards the browser

# Tiny-YOLO

## *Y*ou *O*nly *L*ook *O*nce

- Pretrained model
- Fast **in-browser** image detection

# [fit] Adapt Tiny-YOLO to work on Node.js

- Use `@tensorflow/tfjs-node`
- Store model files locally
- Modify `import`/`export` statements
- Load image file vs. `MediaDevices.getUserMedia()`

### [fit] FYI: I'm running on Tensorflow.js 0.14.2

It is a bit hacky, but runs reliable & that's beautiful!

<br/>

If it ain't broke, don't fix it?

^ I did this months ago and honestly don't wanna mess it up

^ Latest tf.js release is 1.2.8

^ Also prepping rc 2.0

# [fit] Send camera pic to image recognition model on Raspberry Pi

- Hookup PiCamera 
- Use `node-canvas` & create a canvas for the pic
- Crop image to match what model expecting (416 x 416)
- Turn into a tensor & send to the model!

^ Wow, it worked!
