# I built an autonomous necklace

![left fill autoplay loop](photos/ml-necklace.mov)

^ We are at a tech conf, and I'm to spend the next 30 minutes talking about my necklace

^ I still can't believe i built this thing and it works and looks cool.

^ So what is special about this necklace?

^ It's is responding to the number of people around me and adjusting its lighting to correspond with that. It may not be adjusting the way that you would expect, but I'll get to that in a bit.

# [fit] Loaded with tech

![left fit](photos/necklace-schema.jpg)


| Hardware | Software |
| :--- | :--- |
| Raspberry Pi | NodeJS |
| Arduino | TensorflowJS|
| Camera | C++
| LEDs
| Battery

^ How is it responding?

^ Well, as you can see in these 2 lists, I've utilized a lot of different tech to make this.

^ Hopefully, it is a surprise to see all this stuff listed since I hope that I have concealed all the bulky items that allow it to run well!

^ I have 2 main pieces hardware communicating together (rpi & arduino)

^ I have a camera attached to a rpi.

^ Multiple pieces of software - node and tensorflow js running a machine learning model on the pi tucked away on my midsection. This model is receiving the picture taken by the camera and running an image recognition model to identify what it sees.

^ After the ML model on the pi determines how many people it sees, it sends this info to the arduino.

^ I have the arduino running c++ code which then receives this info about it's surroundings and updates the colors and patterns of leds on the necklace based on parameters i've set for how it should respond.

^ FIGURE OUT A TRANSITION HERE

# Making An Autonomous necklace

![left autoplay loop fill](photos/ml-necklace.mov)


^ I've kind of misled you though.

^ I've shown the projects that I made before this and the progression of my work.

^ I honestly didn't realize how my work has built upon the topic of attracting human attention and how others and myself deal with that attention until I started writing this talk.

^ There is a definite moment when I decided to build this project.

---

### I couldn't keep up with a machine learning study group at work.

^But the real reason i built this is because I couldn't keep up with a machine learning study group at work that was doing a big MOOC course.

^ Everyone else learning fast
^ All theoretical no practical/tangible

^ Prove myself & Validate my learning style

## I still know very little

## [fit] I'm good at figuring out things
## I don't understand

^ demotivated alot of this year
