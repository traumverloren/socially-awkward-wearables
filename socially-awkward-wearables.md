<!-- # Outline

- What you are seeing (& not seeing)
- Intent of project
- Reasons
  - ML learning at work
  - Everyone else learning fast
  - All theoretical no practical/tangible
  - ML4A & Coding Train
- About me
- Past work
- Building
  - long process
  - demotivated much of the time
  (https://twitter.com/stephaniecodes/status/1121499375778312193?s=20)
  - easy to hyperfocus and tweak one bit
- Process
  - Tensorflow on Rpi
  - Create LED necklace out of old LED pieces and arduino
  - Hookup Rpi to LEDs and send data to necklace
  - Change LED colors/pattern based on info from pi
- Tensorflowjs on Raspberry Pi
    - 1. can get tiny yolo model running in nodejs?
    (https://twitter.com/stephaniecodes/status/1091036862725218309?s=20)
    - 2. can get tensorflowjs running on pi?
        - at time, arm architecture not supported
        - yalc/build on pi was able to work
    - 3. can I get picamera working and sending pic to model?
- Creating the LED necklace
  - reuse and control blinkytiles with arduino (teensy) & fastled library
    (https://twitter.com/stephaniecodes/status/1095035804106309636?s=20)
  - design and solder blinkytiles necklace (https://twitter.com/stephaniecodes/status/1104838969202786304?s=20)
  - issues with flickering - fixing power issues by switching arduino

# [fit] A very complicated necklace.

![left fit](photos/necklace-schema.jpg)

---

# [fit] A wearable that forces me 
# [fit] to be **AROUND PEOPLE** in order to
# [fit] **NOT** DRAW ATTENTION

---

### I'm introverted, awkward, and anxious in social situations.

---

### I wasn't keeping up with a machine learning study group at work.

^ I couldn't keep up with a machine learning study group at work that was doing a big MOOC course.

^ Everyone else learning fast
^ All theoretical no practical/tangible
^ ML4A & Coding Train


---

# I still have a lot to learn about Machine Learning.
