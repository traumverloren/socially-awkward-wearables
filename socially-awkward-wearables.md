# Outline

- What you are seeing (& not seeing)
- Intent of project
- Reasons
  - ML learning at work
  - Everyone else learning fast
  - All theoretical no practical/tangible
  - ML4A & Coding Train
- About me
- Past work
- Building
  - long process
  - demotivated much of the time
  (https://twitter.com/stephaniecodes/status/1121499375778312193?s=20)
  - easy to hyperfocus and tweak one bit
- Process
  - Tensorflow on Rpi
  - Create LED necklace out of old LED pieces and arduino
  - Hookup Rpi to LEDs and send data to necklace
  - Change LED colors/pattern based on info from pi
- Tensorflowjs on Raspberry Pi
    - 1. can get tiny yolo model running in nodejs?
    (https://twitter.com/stephaniecodes/status/1091036862725218309?s=20)
    - 2. can get tensorflowjs running on pi?
        - at time, arm architecture not supported
        - yalc/build on pi was able to work
    - 3. can I get picamera working and sending pic to model?
- Creating the LED necklace
  - reuse and control blinkytiles with arduino (teensy) & fastled library
    (https://twitter.com/stephaniecodes/status/1095035804106309636?s=20)
  - design and solder blinkytiles necklace (https://twitter.com/stephaniecodes/status/1104838969202786304?s=20)
  - issues with flickering - fixing power issues by switching arduino
    (https://twitter.com/stephaniecodes/status/1113163809005371393?s=12)
    - power issues with teensy arduino, switch to metro mini (https://twitter.com/stephaniecodes/status/1113162729462861825?s=20)
- Hookup Rpi to LEDs and send data to necklace
  - issues

  (https://twitter.com/stephaniecodes/status/1109896218736541696?s=20)
    - sending data from rpi to arduino (https://twitter.com/stephaniecodes/status/1113164378667462656?s=20)
- Writing light program for arduino & optimizing
  - Fixing memory issues / crashing on rpi (https://twitter.com/stephaniecodes/status/1145342670707003392?s=20) and blocking code on arduino program (https://twitter.com/stephaniecodes/status/1145316338329620480?s=20)
  - test fit off mannequin and issues (https://twitter.com/stephaniecodes/status/1153390413643862016?s=20)
