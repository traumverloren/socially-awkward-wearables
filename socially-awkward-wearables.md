# [fit] Loaded with tech

![left fit](photos/necklace-schema.jpg)


| Hardware: | Software: |
| :--- | :--- |
| - Raspberry Pi | - NodeJS |
| - Arduino | - Tensorflow.js|
| - Camera | - C++
| - LEDs
| - Battery


^ Camera is taking a picture

^ Camera is attached to rpi

^ RPI is running NodeJS, tensorflowjs, image recognition model

^  ML model on the pi determines how many people it sees

^ sends info to an arduino.

^ The arduino is controlling the lights on the necklace.

^ it updates the colors and patterns of leds based on parameters i've set for how it should respond.

### [fit] I'm *fascinated* with making myself
### [fit] uncomfortable in public

^ few yrs ago

^ started making lighted clothing

^ thought it beautiful.

^ Burden for me.

^ love them but hard to deal w/ the attention they draw

^ try to channel that anxiety into a fascination & excitement

^ use them to confront my discomfort of the attention they attract.

^ the first project i ever made was...

^ festival

^ copied an instructables tutorial

^ bought a kit with preset light programs

^ sewed to a dress

---

![fill left](photos/bike-ride.jpg)

## [fit] It was weird for me
## [fit] but people liked it

^ I felt awkward, but got lots of compliments.

^ Self-esteem boost.

^ wished it could be more alive & interactive

<br>

^ Gave talks about this project last year, check out link

^  app to control the lights

^ Anyone on the web could change colors and patterns

^ Lots of coding: React, NodeJS, MQTT, Arduino

^ Lots of soldering

---

![50% autoplay loop right](photos/haute-app.mov)

## [fit] a web app for your outfit is
## [fit] both good and bad

^ purposefully wanted to explore creating a temporary experience that connected viewer directly to the artwork for a brief moment.

- question who is the artist in that moment?

^ explore reactions when people realize the lights can be change w/ a web app.

^ Doing it more to please & other people which is OK but less of the direction i was interested in.

^ More focused on me and what i was experiencing.

### [tiny.cc/speech-to-image](http://tiny.cc/speech-to-image)

^ my last project

^ make a necklace that would show related images as i was speaking to someone

^ so ppl find me interesting

^ Raspberry pi with a touchscreen and a microphone.

^ NodeJS server send audio

^ Responsive to the environment

^ still needed wifi

# [fit] with *machine learning*
# [fit] and hadn't realize it.

### (I just thought I was using an API)

^ going to talk about ML & how i used it in my current project, point out that

^ Ironically I also didn't realize I had worked with ML in this project until I really looked back and thought about this project again.

^ ML is so pervasive

^ used it here

^  Just thought I using an API that I sent data to and got a response.

![left autoplay loop fill](photos/ml-necklace.mov)

# [fit] A wearable that forces me
# [fit] to be *around people* in order to
# [fit] *not* DRAW ATTENTION


^ take the things i liked about other projects & go in diff direction

^ responsive to people around me but increases my discomfort unless i conform to social norms

^ obnoxious, flashy, attention getting when alone

^  only calm down when sociable & surround with other people.

^ less about purposefully using lights to attract people

^ more about me wanting to get rid of the lights as fast as possible

^ this progression of my work is a convincing reason for me to build this necklace

^ misled you

---

### shiny New Job at mega tech company

^ moment of self-doubt & inadequacy

^ yr ago, new job at a big tech co

^ felt really insecure with my skills

^ folks started a ML study group

^ falling behind from the first study group

^ i wanted to prove that i could learn all these concepts in my own style.

^ create a physical use case for ML that was relevant to me and my interests

^ the real reason i built this is because I couldn't keep up with a ML study group at work.

---

![autoplay loop](photos/ml4a.mp4)

^ the ML 4 artist courses by gene kogan

^ open my eyes to what artists and non-traditional technologists doing

^ they gave me ideas on how i could integrate ml into a this new wearable project

---

![autoplay loop fit](photos/wekinator.mp4)

![autoplay loop](photos/coding-train.mp4)

^ i wanted to do all the machine learning in JS.

^ Library for training & running machine learning models in the browser
(or Node.js)

^ browser

^ There were 2 things i wasn't sure from beginning if they were even possible:

^ 1. running ml models in node instead of browser

^ 2. run ml models in node on a rpi

^ Pre-trained model

![right fill](photos/got-it-working.png)

# [fit] Adapt Tiny-YOLO to work on Node.js

- Use `@tensorflow/tfjs-node`
- Store model files locally
- Modify `import`/`export` statements
- Load image file vs. `MediaDevices.getUserMedia()`

<br>

[tiny.cc/yolo-pi](http://tiny.cc/yolo-pi)


^ lots of minor code changes to do to run browser based models in node instead.

^ can see in the console statements detecting person

![fit](photos/tfjs-pr.png)

^ i got really lucky that the tf.js team had just made a change for this

^ but released build yet

---

![fit](photos/tensorflow-github.png)

^ i needed to build it locally on my pi from their commit, but it worked, never did that, but it!

---

# [fit] Disclaimer: I'm running on Tensorflow.js 0.14.2

It is a bit hacky, but runs reliable & that's beautiful!

If it isn't broke, why fix it?

^ Latest tf.js release is 1.3.1

^ Also prepping rc 2.0

^ I did this months ago and honestly don't wanna mess it up

^ Lights would pause while processing the JSON received

^ arduino is single threaded and very limited resources
