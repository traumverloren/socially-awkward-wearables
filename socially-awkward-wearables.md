  - Change LED colors/pattern based on info from pi
- Tensorflowjs on Raspberry Pi
    - 1. can get tiny yolo model running in nodejs?
    (https://twitter.com/stephaniecodes/status/1091036862725218309?s=20)
    - 2. can get tensorflowjs running on pi?
        - at time, arm architecture not supported

- Tiny-YOLO
- FastLED

## [fit] *WHY* is just as important as *HOW*

---

# [fit] A wearable that forces me 
# [fit] to be *around people* in order to
# [fit] *not* DRAW ATTENTION

---

### I'm introverted, awkward, & anxious in social situations.

---

### [fit] It's Terrifying & counterinituitive, 

### but I'm fascinated with making myself uncomfortable in public

---

# [fit] Experiments with wearables

^ Over past couple years, I've made a couple of wearable projects to gradually explore wearing lighted wearables in public

^ How people react in general

^ How people react to me being the maker

^ How I react to people reacting

^ fiber optic whip kit

^ base is a flashlight with programmed programs

^ stitched to white dress sewn by my mom.

# Experiment #1:<br/>Jellyfish Dress

- Bought a kit: [tiny.cc/fiber-optic-kit](tiny.cc/fiber-optic-kit)
- Followed an Instructables tutorial
- No coding, pre-programmed
- No soldering, only sewing

---

![fill left](photos/bike-ride.jpg)

## [fit] First time wearing lights 
## [fit] & people liked it!

---

![fill left](photos/bike-ride.jpg)

## [fit] A Bit Lifeless

^ ~6 months coding experience
^ Next logical step was to actually code something

---

![fill autoplay loop](photos/intro-clip.mov)


^ Multiple coordinated pieces
^ Anyone on the web could control the lights

---

![50% autoplay loop right](photos/haute-app.mov)

# Experiment #2:<br/>Haute Codeture

- Lots of coding:
    - React, NodeJS, MQTT, Arduino
- Lots of soldering
- [tiny.cc/haute-codeture](http://tiny.cc/haute-codeture)

---

![fill left](photos/haute-codeture-2.jpg)

## People *really* liked controlling how I looked.

---

![fill left](photos/haute-codeture-2.jpg)

## *Limitations:*
## Dependent on wifi and an app

^ Stuck with keeping my phone on me, having a network connection

---

# Experiment #3:<br/>Speech-to-Image Necklace

![fit left](photos/IMG_6459.mp4)

- Some coding:
    - NodeJS
    - Google cloud speech recognition API
    - Google Custom Search API
- No soldering
- [tiny.cc/speech-to-image](http://tiny.cc/speech-to-image)

---

![fit left autoplay loop](photos/IMG_6459.mp4)

# [fit] Responsive without any direct input

# [fit] but needed wifi to work

---

# [fit] I accidently made something
# [fit] with *machine learning* & didn't realize it.

### I couldn't keep up with a machine learning study group at work.

^But  the real reason i built this is because I couldn't keep up with a machine learning study group at work that was doing a big MOOC course.

^ Everyone else learning fast
^ All theoretical no practical/tangible
^ ML4A & Coding Train


---

### Prove myself

### &

### Validate my learning style

# How I learned some things

- Machine learning for artists  ‚ú®  [https://ml4a.github.io/](https://ml4a.github.io/)
<br/>
- The Coding Train  ‚ú®  [https://thecodingtrain.com/](https://thecodingtrain.com/)

# Reality

<!-- ![left fit](photos/too-much-to-do.png) -->

- Build time: 8 months vs. 3 months
- It was hard and I got demotivated
- I still know very little about machine learning
- I'm good at figuring out things I don't understand

^ demotivated alot of this year
^ easy to hyperfocus and tweak one bit

# Things to Accomplish

1. Get image recognition ML model running on **Node.js**
2. TensorFlow.js on **Raspberry Pi**???
3. Create a beautiful LED necklace
4. Send data from the Raspberry Pi to the necklace
5. Make the necklace responsive to data

# TensorFlow.js

Library for training & running machine learning models in the browser
(or Node.js)

^ it's mostly geared towards the browser

---

# Tiny-YOLO

**Y**ou **O**nly **L**ook **O**nce

<br/>
- Pretrained model
- Fast **in-browser** image detection

---

![left fit](photos/got-it-working.png)

Adapt Tiny-YOLO to work on Node.js

- Use `@tensorflow/tfjs-node`
- Store model files locally
- Modify `import`/`export` statements
