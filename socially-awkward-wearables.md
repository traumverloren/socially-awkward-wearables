### [fit] I'm *fascinated* with making myself 
### [fit] uncomfortable in public

^ I'm a bit introverted, awkward & anxious in social situations.
^ I'm usually always uncomfortable in social settings.

---

# [fit] A wearable that forces me 
# [fit] to be *around people* in order to
# [fit] *not* DRAW ATTENTION

^It's terrifying & counterinituitive but

---

# [fit] Earlier experiments with wearables

^ Over past couple years, I've made a couple of wearable projects to gradually explore wearing lighted wearables in public

^ How people react in general

^ How I react to people reacting

# Fiber Optic Dress

- Bought a kit: [tiny.cc/fiber-optic-kit](tiny.cc/fiber-optic-kit)
- Followed an Instructables tutorial
- No coding, pre-programmed
- No soldering, only sewing

---

![fill left](photos/bike-ride.jpg)

## [fit] First time wearing lights 
## [fit] & people liked it!

---

![fill left](photos/bike-ride.jpg)

## [fit] A Bit Lifeless

^ ~6 months coding experience
^ Next logical step was to actually code something

---

![fill autoplay loop](photos/intro-clip.mov)


^ Multiple coordinated pieces
^ Anyone on the web could control the lights

---

![50% autoplay loop right](photos/haute-app.mov)

# Haute Codeture

- Lots of coding:
    - React, NodeJS, MQTT, Arduino
- Lots of soldering
- [tiny.cc/haute-codeture](http://tiny.cc/haute-codeture)

---

![fill left](photos/haute-codeture-2.jpg)

## People *really* liked controlling how I looked.

---

![fill left](photos/haute-codeture-2.jpg)

## *Limitations:*
## Dependent on wifi and an app

^ Stuck with keeping my phone on me, having a network connection

# Speech-to-Image Necklace

![fit left autoplay loop](photos/IMG_6459.mp4)

- Some coding:
    - NodeJS
    - Google cloud speech recognition API
    - Google Custom Search API
- No soldering
- [tiny.cc/speech-to-image](http://tiny.cc/speech-to-image)

# Making An Autonomous necklace

![left autoplay loop fill](photos/ml-necklace.mov)

^ rest of the talk I want to talk through how i built this and the different tech challenges i faced

---

### I couldn't keep up with a machine learning study group at work.

^But the real reason i built this is because I couldn't keep up with a machine learning study group at work that was doing a big MOOC course.

^ Everyone else learning fast
^ All theoretical no practical/tangible

^ Prove myself & Validate my learning style

![autoplay loop](photos/ml4a.mp4)

^ NOTES

---


## It was hard and
## I got demotivated

^ Build time: 8 months vs. 3 months

---

## I still know very little 
## about machine learning

---

## [fit] I'm good at figuring out things
## I don't understand

^ demotivated alot of this year
^ easy to hyperfocus and tweak one bit

# [fit] Adapt Tiny-YOLO to work on Node.js

- Use `@tensorflow/tfjs-node`
- Store model files locally
- Modify `import`/`export` statements
- Load image file vs. `MediaDevices.getUserMedia()`

# FYI: I'm running on Tensorflow.js 0.14.2

It is a bit hacky, but runs reliable & that's beautiful!

<br/>

If it ain't broke, don't fix it?

^ I did this months ago and honestly don't wanna mess it up

^ Latest tf.js release is 1.2.8

^ Also prepping rc 2.0

# [fit] Send camera pic to image recognition model on Raspberry Pi

- Hookup PiCamera 
- Use `node-canvas` & create a canvas for the pic
- Crop image to match what model expecting (416 x 416)
- Turn into a tensor & send to the model!

^ 5V possible, but with a bit of modification
^ Outside my abilities at the time
^ So switched boards instead
