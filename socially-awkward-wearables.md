# I built an autonomous necklace

![left fill autoplay loop](photos/ml-necklace.mov)

^ We are at a tech conf, and I'm to spend the next 30 minutes talking about my necklace

^ I still can't believe i built this thing and it works and looks cool.

^ So what is special about this necklace?

^ It's is responding to the number of people around me and adjusting its lighting to correspond with that. It may not be adjusting the way that you would expect, but I'll get to that in a bit.

# [fit] Loaded with tech

![left fit](photos/necklace-schema.jpg)


| Hardware | Software |
| :--- | :--- |
| Raspberry Pi | NodeJS |
| Arduino | TensorflowJS|
| Camera | C++
| LEDs
| Battery

^ How is it responding?

^ Well, as you can see in these lists, I've utilized a lot of different tech to make this work.

^ Hopefully, it is a surprise to see all this stuff listed since I hope that I have concealed all the bulky items that allow it to run well!

^ I have 2 main pieces of hardware communicating together (rpi & arduino)

^ I have a camera attached to a rpi.

^ Multiple pieces of software - node and tensorflowjs are running a machine learning model on the pi that is tucked away on my midsection. This model is receiving the picture taken by the camera and running an image recognition model to identify what it sees.

^ After the ML model on the pi determines how many people it sees, it sends this info to the arduino.

^ I have the arduino running c++ code which then receives this info about it's surroundings and updates the colors and patterns of leds on the necklace based on parameters i've set for how it should respond.

^ FIGURE OUT A TRANSITION HERE!!!!!

### [fit] I'm *fascinated* with making myself 
### [fit] uncomfortable in public

^ I'm a bit introverted, awkward & anxious in social situations.
^ It's usually a guarantee that i'm uncomfortable in social settings.

# [fit] A wearable that forces me 
# [fit] to be *around people* in order to
# [fit] *not* DRAW ATTENTION

^ It's terrifying & counterinituitive but
^ EXPLAIN THIS SLIDE BETTER

# [fit] I've been evolving my exploration of this 
# [fit]topic without even realizing it

^ I've been exploring this topic in increasingly complex projects over the past couple years without even realizing it.

^ Increasingly curious of:

^ How people react in general

^ How I react to people reacting

^ saw someone's work in a instructables tutorial and copied it exactly.

^ fiber optic whip kit

^ base is a flashlight with programmed programs

^ stitched to white dress sewn by my mom.
^ No coding, pre-programmed
^ No soldering, only sewing

### [tiny.cc/haute-codeture](http://tiny.cc/haute-codeture)

<br>

^ last year i made this project
^ Multiple coordinated pieces
^ lights controlled over wifi with a web app
^ Anyone on the web could control the lights
^ Lots of coding:
^React, NodeJS, MQTT, Arduino
^ Lots of soldering
^ Gave talks about this project last year, check out link

---

![fill left](photos/haute-codeture-2.jpg)

## *Limitations:*
## Dependent on wifi and an app

^ thing that made it possible was also my least fav thing about it
^ Stuck with keeping my phone on me, having a network connection

---

![50% autoplay loop right](photos/haute-app.mov)

## People *really* liked controlling how I looked.

^ Realized I was doing it more to please and surprise people which is OK but less of the direction i was interested in.

^ Wanted to take away the need direct interaction.

### [tiny.cc/speech-to-image](http://tiny.cc/speech-to-image)

^ next project I did, i also did last year.
^ I have a raspberry pi with a touchscreen plugged and a microphone. 
^ The, I have it running a
^ NodeJS server with
^ Google cloud speech recognition API
^ Google Custom Search API
^ that is sending what i say to the google speech recognition api and then performing a custom image search of key words it picks out from what i'm saying and then shows an image to correlate.
^ No soldering
^ Responsive to the environment
^ still needed wifi

### (I just thought I was using an API)

^ Ironically I also didn't realize I had really worked with ML before this current project until I really looked back and thought about this project.

^ ML is so ubiquitous/pervasive, I used it in this project and didn't really understand that I was using it.

^ I was just using an API that I sent data to and got a response.

^ I wasn't particularly excited about ML at the time tbh nor thought it was "my thing"

# Making An Autonomous necklace

![left autoplay loop fill](photos/ml-necklace.mov)

^ so that's the projects that have been leading up to this one and and how i have progressed in my work with wearables.

^ honestly i didn't quite realize how my all work has built upon the topic of attracting human attention and observing how others and myself deal with that attention until I started writing this talk.

^ I've kind of misled you though. Though this progression of my work is a convincing reason for me to build this project, 

^ There is a definite moment when I decided to build it.

---

### I couldn't keep up with a machine learning study group at work.

^But the real reason i built this is because I couldn't keep up with a machine learning study group at work that was doing a big MOOC course.

^ Everyone else learning fast
^ All theoretical, no practical/tangible
^ i was falling behind from the first study group and was beating myself up about it.
^ i had just started a new job at mega tech corp and felt really insecure (still do, that doesn't change unfortunately).
^ i wanted to prove myself & validate my learning style

![autoplay loop](photos/ml4a.mp4)

^ NOTES

---


## It was hard and
## I got demotivated

^ Build time: 3 months into 8+ months

---

## I still know very little 
## about machine learning

^ I know the minimum to setup a trained model and run my data through it.

^ I envisioned by this time this year i'd be doing other weird things with deep learning and training models and generating weird art but I haven't gotten to it yet.

---

## [fit] I'm good at figuring out things
## I don't understand

^ demotivated alot of this year
^ easy to hyperfocus and tweak one bit
^ but i persevered and took breaks when i needed them but still put in the work.

# Autonomous Necklace Recipe

1. **Get image recognition ML model running on Node.js**
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

^ There were several steps i had to take to make this necklace.

^ There were 2 things i wasn't sure if they were even possible when i started:
^ 1. running ml models in node instead of browser
^ 2. run ml models in node on a rpi
 so i wanted to tackle those first before i invested time in making a wearable.

---

## TensorFlow.js

^ i wanted to do all the machine learning in JS.

^ Library for training & running machine learning models in the browser
(or Node.js)

^ it's mostly geared towards the browser

^ there are other libraries but this is well-supported with many pre-trained models and info on the internet.
